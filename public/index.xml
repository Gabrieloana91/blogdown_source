      <description>What is the point of collecting data if there are no actions taken from it?
Instead of the team reading endless blocks of text, it is often much easier to read a graph and assess the performance / problems.
Analysts should always express the key insights as understandable as possible for the rest of the team which might not be acustomed with the analytic jargon.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this blog is to document all cool stuff I do in my job. A few technical aspects about the software I use:
- R Studio Version 1.0.153
- R Version 3.4.1
- Windows 10 - 64 bit
The data used on this blog is data I have collected from my World of Tanks game play. (Disclaimer: I am not the best. Not the worst either!) All the data I collect is available here.</description>
