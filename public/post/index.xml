      <description>Recently, I had to look at different devices and their specs to build an idea about which are the best devices at the moment. As there are many types and manufacturers, I was inefficient at looking through each model on gsmarena and decided to look for a better solution. So I have stumbled upon FonoApi. This amazing website gives out tokens to use with their API via Python, Curl, jQuery or NodeJS to retrieve specifications about almost any device ever built.</description>

      <description>What is the point of collecting data if there are no actions taken from it?
Instead of the team reading endless blocks of text, it is often much easier to read a graph and assess the performance / problems.
Analysts should always express the key insights as understandable as possible for the rest of the team which might not be acustomed with the analytic jargon.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this blog is to document all cool stuff I do in my job. A few technical aspects about the software I use:
- R Studio Version 1.0.153
- R Version 3.4.1
- Windows 10 - 64 bit
The data used on this blog is data I have collected from my World of Tanks game play. (Disclaimer: I am not the best. Not the worst either!) All the data I collect is available here.</description>
