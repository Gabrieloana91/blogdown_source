      <description>Recently, I had to look at different devices and their specs to build an idea about which are the best devices at the moment. As there are many types and manufacturers, I was inefficient at looking through each model on gsmarena and decided to look for a better solution. So I have stumbled upon FonoApi. This amazing website gives out tokens to use with their API via Python, Curl, jQuery or NodeJS to retrieve specifications about almost any device ever built.</description>
