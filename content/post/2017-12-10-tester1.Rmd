The purpose of this blog is to document all cool stuff I do in my job. 
The data used on this blog is data I have collected from my World of Tanks game play. (Disclaimer: I am not the best. Not the worst either!)
I am going to put chunks of the data I am using for you to see how the data looks like everytime I am showcasing something new. 

So, this being said, here is a sample of data:

```{r, include = F, warning=FALSE}

df <- read.csv("Z:\\Analytics Work\\Side Projects\\World of Tanks\\raw_data.csv")

```

You can download the data from [here](../data_files/raw_data.csv)
