The purpose of this blog is to document all cool stuff I do in my job.
A few technical aspects about the software I use:  
- R Studio Version 1.0.153  
- R Version 3.4.1  
- Windows 10 - 64 bit  


The data used on this blog is data I have collected from my World of Tanks game play. (Disclaimer: I am not the best. Not the worst either!)
All the data I collect is available here. This will be used for all the future posts.

```{r, include = F, warning=FALSE}

df <- read.csv("Z:\\Analytics Work\\Side Projects\\World of Tanks\\raw_data.csv")

```

You can download the data from [here](../data_files/raw_data.csv)
