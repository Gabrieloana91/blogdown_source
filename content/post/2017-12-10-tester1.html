<p>The purpose of this blog is to document all cool stuff I do in my job. A few technical aspects about the software I use:<br />
- R Studio Version 1.0.153<br />
- R Version 3.4.1<br />
- Windows 10 - 64 bit</p>
<p>The data used on this blog is data I have collected from my World of Tanks game play. (Disclaimer: I am not the best. Not the worst either!) All the data I collect is available here. This will be used for all the future posts.</p>
<p>You can download the data from <a href="../data_files/raw_data.csv">here</a></p>
